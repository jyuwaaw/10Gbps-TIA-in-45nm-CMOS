# 10Gbps-TIA-in-45nm-CMOS
This project involved the design and simulation of a 10 Gbps Transimpedance Amplifier (TIA) using 65/45nm CMOS technology. The primary goal was to achieve high performance while meeting specific requirements for gain, bandwidth, input-referred noise (IRN), and power consumption.
